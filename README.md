## Architecture

- **BetterBlueKit**: Swift package handling all API communication
- **SwiftData**: Modern Core Data replacement for persistence
- **SwiftUI**: Declarative UI framework
- **Combine/Async**: Reactive programming and concurrency
- **CloudKit**: iCloud sync for settings and accounts

## Development

### Linting
The project uses SwiftLint for code style enforcement:
```bash
swiftlint lint
```

### Debugging
- HTTP requests are logged in the app under Settings > HTTP Logs
- Vehicle status can be monitored in real-time
- Fake vehicles support custom scenarios for testing

## Privacy & Security

- **Credentials**: Stored securely in iCloud with SwiftData
- **Network**: All API calls use HTTPS encryption

## Important Notes

- **Subscription Required**: You need an active BlueLink/Kia Connect subscription
- **Battery Impact**: Frequent remote commands may drain your vehicle's 12V battery
- **Rate Limits**: Respect API rate limits to avoid account suspension
- **Unofficial**: This app is not affiliated with Hyundai or Kia
- **Terms of Service**: Ensure you comply with your vehicle service terms
